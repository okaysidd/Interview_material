Difficulty:Medium
Given an array nums, you are allowed to choose one element of nums and change it by any value in one move.

Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after perfoming at most 3 moves.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
Output: 1
Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1]. 
The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]
Output: 2
Example 4:

Input: nums = [1,5,6,14,15]
Output: 1

Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums

Difficulty:Medium
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays from the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2 numbers.

Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in the new array. Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

 Stone Game IV
User Accepted:1075

Total Submissions:3034
Difficulty:Hard
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are n stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer n. Return True if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return False, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
Example 3:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
Example 4:

Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). 
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
Example 5:

Input: n = 17
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
