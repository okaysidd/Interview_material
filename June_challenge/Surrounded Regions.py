Surrounded Regions
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example:
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

Explanation:
Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
"""
class Solution:
	"""
	Not the best solution, find all islands ('O') that start with/touch the
	border, and flip them to 'B'. Then flip all other 'O' to 'X' and all 'B'
	to 'X'.
	Another way to think about it- we have to find all the 'O' cells that
	do not have a path to the border elements.
